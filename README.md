# Academic website template

This template is based on the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme, more specifically the adaptation of the (blog) theme to academic portfolio website by [Maximilia Kasy](https://github.com/maxkasy/home).

## Configuration

Edit the `_config.yml` file.

Change the `assets/images/avatar.jpg` picture, make sure it is a square image otherwise the image will look like an ellipse, not a circle.

Go to your project Settings / Pages, set source to the branch you are hosting the site on (`main`, `gh-pages`), from root (`/`). Click Save, set 'Enforce HTTPS` if you like.

!!! ADD HERE HOW TO SET UP CUSTOM DOMAIN !!!

## Build

R code in the `_src` folder.
